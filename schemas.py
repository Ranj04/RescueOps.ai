    The Commander's policy-bound decisions mean a run finishes in one of three ways:
      - status="resolved"          — fully done; verification + postmortem present.
                                      Reached AUTONOMOUSLY when remediation produced
                                      no risky actions, or after a human decides on
                                      the risky ones and verification passes.
      - status="awaiting_approval" — safe actions have already been auto-executed
                                      (see `executed_safe`); one or more risky
                                      actions are pending a human decision. This can
                                      happen a second time if a failed-verification
                                      retry proposes new risky actions — approval is
                                      policy-forced and the Commander cannot bypass it.
      - status="escalated"         — the Commander (or the retry cap) escalated to a
                                      human instead of continuing: either diagnosis
                                      confidence was too low to dispatch remediation,
                                      or verification failed and the retry cap (per
                                      policy.json) was reached. Terminal; no postmortem.
    `diagnosis` is null when triage fast-pathed a low-severity incident straight to
    remediation. `remediation` is null when diagnosis escalated before remediation ran.
    `state_snapshot` is the serialized IncidentStateMachine (see state_machine.py) —
    opaque to callers, required by `resume_after_approval` to continue the same run.
